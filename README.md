# PicSearch 🔍

use google reverse image search to search the image on your device.


## About this project

PicSearch is a super lightweight utility that hooks into Android Share Sheet. Let you quickly find the source of an image using Google Lens.

*   **Works from anywhere:** Use it from your photo gallery, web browser, or any app that can share images or links.
*   **Share an image:** Share a picture file directly from your phone.
*   **Share a link:** Share a URL that points to an image.

## How It Works

When you share an image file, Google Lens needs a public URL to analyze it. PicSearch makes this happen seamlessly:

1.  The app receives the shared image.
2.  It uploads the image to the temporary file hosting service **[tmpfiles.org](https://tmpfiles.org/)**.
3.  `tmpfiles.org` provides a direct, temporary link to that image.
4.  The app then hands this link over to Google Lens for the reverse image search.
